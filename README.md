# linked_list_C
Basically, me implementing a singly linked list (and a bunch of supporting functions)... for fun.

If you want to test it out yourself, git clone then run `make` in the project root directory, then `make run`, or just execute `./bin/app`. The app will prompt you with different ways you can manipulate the linked lists I've implemented. 

If, for some reason, you want to use this in your own code, you can throw `./include/mks_LL.h` and/or `./include/mks_cli.h` into your project's include directory, and build it against `./src/mks_LL.c` and/or `./src/mks_cli.c`.
